            <p>
                I always wonder what beer to get at a bar. There are way too many choices for a casual beer
                drinker and I usually know just a few beers out of the dozens of choices there. Thus, I decided to build 
                a beer recommendation engine based on online user reviews, which were scraped from one of the most 
                popular beer review sites. Running multithreaded Python web crawlers on an Ubuntu server for a few days,
                pretty much the entire site was successfully scraped and the data was temporary stored into MongoDB,
                because the data was unstructured. For example, some seasonal beers had extra rating fields and they
                were unknown until they were scraped. At the end, in the NoSQL, there were 6,899,254 reviews, 319,483
                beer data, and 362,602 user info. Finally, after significant data munging, these raw data was migrated
                to PostgreSQL from MongoDB for machine learning and analysis purposes.
            </p>

            <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>
                This beer recommendation engine is built on collaborative-filtering approach. Since the review-rating
                matrix is sparse, cosine similarity was suitable to calculate similarities between beers. This app
                recommends top 10 beers by taking user inputs and comparing against this pre-computed matrix.
